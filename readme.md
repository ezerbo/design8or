# Design8or (Designator)
Assigns a lead from a list of candidates to handle a task (anything that can be done in rotation) using a Round Robin algorithm.
Candidates participate in a designation pool and everyone has to be designated before the pool is considered closed.

Please find the use cases below

- Candidates are automatically designated by the system.
  - A candidate is designated randomly from the list of candidates that have not yet participated in the current pool
  - The designated candidate will receive an email with details about the designation
- Candidates can accept or decline the designation
  - When a candidate accepts the designation, a new assignment will be created
  - When a candidate declines the designation, a request will be broadcast to all candidates that have not yet participated in the current pool
  - The first candidate to accept a broadcast designation request will get the assignment
- Candidates can be created, updated & deleted
- Some parameters are stored in the database and can be updated from the application.
- Browser notifications can be sent to candidates who have subscribed
